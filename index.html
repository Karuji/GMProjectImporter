<p>Importing one Game Maker: Studio project into another.</p>

<p>If you've ever gone and prototyped some functionality in a fresh project to make sure it works just the way you want? Did you want to bring that functionality back into your main project because the prototype works just the way you want it to?</p>

<p>Well GM won't let you :( 
GMProjectImporter does :D!</p>

<a id="how-to-use-gmprojectimporter" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-gmprojectimporter" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use GMProjectImporter</h4>

<p>Right you you will need to download the source and run in Python 3.3+</p>

<p>GMPI will then question your readiness to use it!
Really don't use it unless you have a backup or are using version control!</p>

<p>It will then ask for a source project.gmx and a target project.gmx</p>

<p>Once you give it those two files it will go though them merging them, and then it will go through their folders grabing up all the new little bits that will make Game Maker think that was all added normally.</p>

<p>GMProjectImporter is new and still in <strong>Alpha</strong>. Everything is new and freshly coded. I started coding it when Game Maker wouldn't let me import one project into another. I'm pretty sure other developers must have similar kind desires to work with GM where you can prototype and import, and hoped that it would be useful to other developers if I shared it.</p>
